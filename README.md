# Customs Tax Calculator

## INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the **Customs Tax Calculator**. Please do read the instructions properly to avoid unnecessary errors 
(**Don't skip them!**):"
1. Only **numeric inputs** are **accepted**, **negative numeric inputs** and **non-numeric inputs** are 
**automatically** considered as an **error** by the program.
2. Do not **leave anything blank** as the program will **not allow** it, if in any case the amount to be computed is 
zero (0) then input the number zero (0).
3. Do not go **beyond the number of choices** since it will prompt you of an **INVALID INPUT**.
4. You can **terminate** the program from inputting the **assigned number** if you want to quit the app.

## NOTES:
These are the **duties, taxes, and other charges** that will be calculated using this project: (The computations are 
still incomplete since it does not account to the missing components and the backward computation for each computation)
